        About Me
    </div>
    <div id="paragraphText">
        Hello, my name is James Lack. I grew up on Long Island and graduated from SUNY Albany. I enjoy spending time outdoors, coding, exploring different foods, and expressing my creativity. Currently, I am employed as a Senior QA Engineer at Book of the Month, where I have been working since 2022.

        For a while, I had contemplated starting a blog about my experiences as a Quality Assurance Engineer, but I never followed through with it. However, I recently decided to take the leap and create this blog. I have not yet decided on a specific direction for this blog, but I plan to cover topics that I find interesting or inspiring. Although I have only been in the field for five years, I have been fortunate enough to work for many outstanding companies, which has given me a wealth of valuable work experiences. Ultimately, I hope that whoever reads this blog will find my insights helpful and entertaining.
