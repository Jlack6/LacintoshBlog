        Question And Answer Engineer
    </div>
    <div id="paragraphText">
        When people first hear "QA Engineer," they often think of "Question and Answer Engineer," or at least, that's what many of my family members thought when I first started working in QA. Now, anyone in tech knows that QA stands for "Quality Assurance," but maybe my family wasn't entirely wrong. In QA, we need to ask a lot of questions to understand how and why things work. We also need to provide answers to various stakeholders, engineers, and other departments. When I really sat down and thought about it, "Questions" and "Answers" pretty much sum up a significant part of QA. It's more than that, but being good at these two things will really help you in the long run.
    </div>
    <div id="paragraphText">
        Let's start with "Questions." Asking the right questions is crucial because they can help you understand what people truly want from a new feature or product. Wrong questions aren't necessarily bad either because they can eventually guide you to where you need to go. The worst thing you can do is have no questions at all. Asking questions can be challenging, as some people fear that coworkers will become frustrated with their lack of understanding. However, in my career, I've found that people are always willing to help, especially in great companies. You just need to keep reminding yourself that the more you know about a project, the better you'll be at testing it.

    <div id="paragraphText">
        Answers are challenging because sometimes you don't have all of them. People will come to your desk and say, "Hey, how does this work?" or "Why is this broken?" You'll sit there and have no clue what to say (often). What you can't do is get nervous. If you don't know the answer to something, communicate that and then find out how to get it. You never want to provide false information because it hurts the whole team in the long run. Communication is one of the best traits of a good QA Engineer because you'll need to talk a lotâ€”to everyone.
    </div>
    <div id="paragraphText">
        Let's say you have the answers, and you know everything. That's great, but what's even better is writing everything down and documenting it for others. Keeping some type of QA notes or Wiki is incredibly helpful to your QA team and members of other departments. Writing things down ensures that valuable testing steps and information never get lost.
