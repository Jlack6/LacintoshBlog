        A Good Project
    </div>
    <div id="paragraphText">
        I love a good project. The feeling of starting something new and exciting is exhilarating. One of the earliest projects I built was a laser keyboard computer with my cousin. We camped out in my uncle's garage and diligently took apart a 2005 iMac G5. We disassembled everything and then rebuilt the computer with a laser keyboard built into it. To us, it was beautiful. It was a scrappy proof of concept, and we loved it. I then submitted the design and a presentation to the Hackaday competition with the hopes of winning the prize that could maybe be seed money for something great.

    <div id="paragraphText">
        Weeks went by without any word from the Hackaday judges. I was becoming impatient with the idea that they didn’t think this was the greatest thing ever. I thought we struck gold. Eventually, the judges did get back to us, and we didn’t even make it past the first round. When you are young and truly believe in something, it is devastating to get feedback that you weren’t anticipating.

    <div id="paragraphText">
        The project was a failure, but the lessons learned were more valuable than the prize money would have been. This project sparked a curiosity in me around software and hardware that I still carry with me to this day. It’s one of the foundations of my earlier software career and propelled me into many other amazing projects. This failed proof of concept actually got me my internship with the Department of Education during college. So never consider a project a failure because you never know what doors it might open for you in the future.
