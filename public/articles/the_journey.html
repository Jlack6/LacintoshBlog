        The Journey
    </div>
    <div id="paragraphText">
        My career only began 5 years ago, which is short, but I got into programming when I was 15 years old, and I knew it was what I wanted to do with my life. Now, QA is something I completely fell into. When I graduated, I wasn't able to get a job at all, let alone get an interview. It was shocking because I had 2 solid years of internship experiences. I thought I did everything right.
    </div>
    <div id="paragraphText">
        In the summer of 2018, I was probably applying to 10 jobs a day. Eventually, I got an email for an interview with a QA position. To be honest, I didn't really want to do QA work. It was a manual testing job, and I wanted to program. The reality of the situation was that I needed a job, and it was worth just hearing out what they had to say.

    <div id="paragraphText">
        After completing the interview process, they offered me the job. The first few months involved a lot of manual testing, and I was barely programming during work. After work, I was trying to figure out how I could use programming skills to help me become better at QA Engineer. As I was reading through things online, I came across Selenium, which is a testing framework that uses various languages to test a website using automation. Learning about the career path of a QA Automation Engineer changed everything for me. I eventually went into work and pitched the idea of making a Java and Selenium application that could be used to test the site instead of manual regression testing. They loved the idea, and after a few months, we were using this application to test the website completely before releases.
    </div>
    <div id="paragraphText">
        Since then, I've been building automation and getting to work on all types of projects. I stumbled into the world of QA, and now it's what I plan to do with my career. That's why sometimes it's not about the destination but really the journey. You need to experience as much as you can to learn what you like to do.
