        <h1>Privacy Policy for Scrib Notes</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 02/29/2024</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Scrib Notes, a swift iOS app available on the Apple App Store. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle the data you input into our app, emphasizing our commitment to your privacy.</p>

        <h2>2. Data Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>Scrib Notes is a simple note-taking app that allows you to jot down reminders and notes. The data we collect is limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>User Input:</strong> The notes and reminders you enter into the app, including dates, times, and task descriptions for reminders.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data is stored locally on your device in JSON format, specifically within the "Reminders.json" and "alarms.json" files for active reminders and the "CompletedReminders.json" for completed ones. We do not have access to this data, nor do we store it on any external servers.</p>

        <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
        <p>Your data's security is paramount to us. Since all data, including your reminders, is stored locally on your device, the security of your notes and reminders is managed through the security features of your iOS device. We recommend not storing sensitive information in your notes or reminders as we do not use any level of encryption. We do not have access to this data, nor do we have any mechanisms to access this data remotely.</p>

        <h2>4. Managing Your Data</h2>
        <p>You can manage your data directly within the Scrib Notes app. You have the ability to delete individual reminders or all reminders from your device. The app uses the UserNotifications framework to schedule and manage reminders, which can all be edited or removed within the app interface.</p>

        <h2>5. Deletion of App and Data</h2>
        <p>Deleting the Scrib Notes app from your device will also delete all associated data, including the "Reminders.json", "alarms.json", and "CompletedReminders.json" files stored locally on your device. Currently, Scrib Notes does not offer a built-in feature for backing up or exporting data. Therefore, if you decide to delete the app from your device, please be aware that all your data, including notes and reminders, will be permanently lost.</p>

        <h2>6. Apple Connect Data</h2>
        <p>Scrib Notes utilizes Apple Connect for app distribution. Any data collected through Apple Connect, such as download statistics or basic usage data, is governed by Apple's Privacy Policy. Scrib Notes does not have access to any personal information collected by Apple through Apple Connect.</p>

        <h2>7. No External Data Transfer</h2>
        <p>Scrib Notes does not use any external APIs or databases. All data remains on your device unless you choose to export or share it through your own means. We do not collect, store, or transfer your data to any external parties.</p>

        <h2>8. Web Linking</h2>
        <p>In the Scrib Notes app, on the settings page, there are three buttons that link out to the web: "Visit ScribNotes Web Page", "Terms of Use", and "Privacy Policy". Selecting these buttons will navigate you away from the Scrib Notes app and direct you to our website or to specific pages detailing our terms of use and privacy policy. Please be aware that when you leave our app, you are subject to the privacy policies and terms of conditions of those external sites.</p>

        <h2>9. Acceptance of This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>By downloading and using Scrib Notes, you acknowledge and agree to the collection and use of your information as outlined in this Privacy Policy. We commit to protecting your privacy and handling your information responsibly and transparently.</p>

        <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes to our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Revised" date, and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible.</p>

        <h2>11. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us through the support options provided on the Apple App Store.</p>
